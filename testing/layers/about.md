### Design scripts ###

@brief  Simple scripts that incrementally test design of PuzzleScene API.

The PuzzleScene code file has the major classes and implementation for
performing processing of the scene.  It starts out basic with simple
tracking, but will ultimately evolve to perform more robust data association
of the puzzle pieces over time.

design01    Tests configuration creation, saving, and sub-algorithm instantiation.
design02    Runs the default configuration on actual image stream data (Realsense D435).
