@defgroup TestSurveillance	Surveillance

@brief	Work space surveillance implementations and API usage showcases.

There are many reasons to implement a surveillance-type of system.  The main
one leading to the development of this python code over our original Matlab
code is for tracking progress and productivity for a puzzle solving task.  
The original Matlab code tracked progress and productivity for construction tasks.
Sometimes the words ``scene'' and ``layers'' are used interchangeably, when it is really
the case that the scene described the gestalt and layers are what compose the
scene.

@defgroup TestSurveillance_Dev	    Development Code

@brief  Consists of code used to test and flesh out core functionality of classes.

@defgroup TestSurveillance_Layers	Scene Layers 

@brief	Integrates detection, tracking, etc. for multiple object classes associated to different
	scene layers.

The layers should have semantic meaning and separate items in the scene
according to some commonality.

### Puzzle Design Scripts ###

Many of the testing/development scripts incrementally test design of PuzzleScene API.
The PuzzleScene code file has the major classes and implementation for
performing processing of the scene.  It starts out basic with simple tracking,
but will ultimately evolve to perform more robust data association of the
puzzle pieces over time.  

@defgroup TestSurveillance_Activity	    Activity / Action Recognition 

@brief  For interpreting movement or state changes in scene.
